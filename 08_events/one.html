    /* third argument to the addEventListener method is the event propagation which is set to false byDefault and
         it has 2 contexts 
         1. Event Bubbling (Default Behavior):: 
         In Event Bubbling , the event starts from the target element (the deepest nested element where the event was
          triggered) and bubbles up through its ancestors, going up to the root (html)
        2. Event Capturing (also known as Event Trickling)::
        In Event Trickling , the event starts from the root element and travels down to the target element*/


    // document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener("click", (e) => {console.log("Owl clicked")}, false)
    // document.getElementById('images').addEventListener("click", (e) => {console.log("Clicked inside the ul")}, false)
    /* Note that , we are adding an EventListener on the 'ul' element which has 5 'li' element and adding another event 
    on li with id 'owl' . So , when we click on any of the li's other than the one with id 'owl' we get a message 
    in console saying "clicked inside the ul" but when we click on the li with id 'owl' first we get the message "
    owl clicked " then "clicked inside the ul ", this is called event bubbling : so the event is being propagated from 
    target to the parent and ancestors and so on... 
    If we need to stop that propagation we can use the stopPropagation() method*/
    // document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener("click", (e) => { e.stopPropagation();console.log("Owl clicked") }, false)
    // document.getElementById('images').addEventListener("click", (e) => {  console.log("Clicked inside the ul") }, false)
    // now when we click on the owl the propagation will stop and we get the single message "owl clicked"
    // Now following is the example of Event Capturing or Event Trickling
//    document.getElementById('owl').addEventListener("click", (e) => {  console.log("Owl clicked") }, true)
//     document.getElementById('images').addEventListener("click", (e) => { console.log("Clicked inside the ul") }, true)
    /* Note that in event Capturing event is propagated from parent to child whether we click on owl or some other 
    li we will first get the parent message which says "clicked inside the ul " and then the "owl" clicked will be 
    printed in the console*/
    // we have another technique e.preventDefault() let's look at the following example
    // document.getElementById('google').addEventListener("click", (e) => {console.log("google clicked");e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation()}, false)
    /* Note that :: the default behaviour for an anchor tag is that whenever we click we are redirected to the link
    but when we use the preventDefault() method on the event which is being propagated , we get the message in console but
    not redirected to the link provided */

    document.querySelector('#images').addEventListener("click", function(e) {
        console.log(e.target.parentNode)
        if (e.target.tagName === "IMG"){
            // console.log(e.target.id);
            
            let removeIt = e.target.parentNode
            // removeIt.remove();
            removeIt.parentNode.removeChild(removeIt)
        }

<!--   !TOP Event Properties::
*: type : The type of the event that was triggered (e.g. click, keydown, mousemove) 
?: useCase : knowing which event was fired can help you handle multiple types of events with a single listener
*: target: The element on which the event occurred.
?: Use Case: Access the element that triggered the event, which is useful for identifying the source of the event in complex UIs.

*: currentTarget: The element to which the event listener is attached.
?: Use Case: Useful in event delegation to know the element that is handling the event, especially when target and currentTarget differ.
*: timeStamp: Time (in milliseconds) since the document was loaded when the event was created.
?: Use Case: Track the timing of events for performance or analytics purposes.
*: defaultPrevented: Indicates whether event.preventDefault() was called to prevent the default action.
?: Use Case: Ensure that default actions (like form submission or link navigation) are stopped when desired.
*: clientX / clientY: X and Y coordinates of the event relative to the viewport (visible area of the browser).
?: Use Case: Determine where a mouse event occurred on the screen (e.g., for custom tooltips, drag-and-drop).
*: screenX / screenY: X and Y coordinates of the event relative to the screen.
?: Use Case: Detect the position on the screen for multi-monitor setups or for interactions where screen coordinates matter.
*: altKey / ctrlKey / shiftKey / metaKey: Boolean values that indicate whether the Alt, Ctrl, Shift, or Meta (Command/Windows) keys were pressed during the event.
?: Use Case: Detect modifier keys for advanced keyboard shortcuts or mouse interactions.
*: relatedTarget: The element that the pointer left or entered during mouseover, mouseout, focus, or blur events.
?: Use Case: Manage interactions during focus changes or hovering transitions between elements.
*: key / code: key provides the string of the key pressed (e.g., "a", "Enter"), while code provides the physical key code.
?: Use Case: Handle keyboard shortcuts and key events more precisely, including differentiating between keys based on physical location.
*: buttons (Mouse Events): Indicates which mouse buttons are pressed (left, right, middle, etc.).
?: Use Case: Manage complex mouse interactions like drag-and-drop or multi-button mouse handling.
*: pointerId / pointerType (Pointer Events): Identifier and type of pointer device (e.g., mouse, pen, touch).
?: Use Case: Handle pointer-specific events for multi-input devices (touch screens, styluses, etc.).

                         !Top Event Methods::
*: preventDefault(): Prevents the browserâ€™s default behavior for the event.
?: Use Case: Stop default actions like form submission or link navigation and replace them with custom logic.
*: stopPropagation(): Stops the event from propagating (bubbling) up the DOM tree.
?: Use Case: Ensure that only the current element handles the event and no parent elements are triggered.
*: stopImmediatePropagation(): Stops the event from propagating and prevents any remaining event listeners from being executed.
?: Use Case: Used when you want to ensure no other event handlers on the same element or parent elements are fired.
*: isTrusted: Boolean indicating whether the event was triggered by the user (true) or programmatically (false).
?: Use Case: Verify that an event is user-initiated for security and UX purposes.
*: composedPath(): Returns an array of elements on which the event is dispatched, starting from the target and ending at the root.
?: Use Case: Trace the full propagation path of an event, especially in complex shadow DOM structures or deeply nested elements.
*: initEvent() (Deprecated but useful for learning legacy code): Initializes a newly created event object before it's dispatched.
?: Use Case: Customizing events in older codebases.
*: getModifierState(): Checks the state of modifier keys (e.g., "Shift", "CapsLock") during the event.
?: Use Case: Handle dynamic keyboard inputs, particularly useful for games, text inputs, or advanced UI controls.
*: persist() (React-specific method): Prevents React from clearing the event object after a synthetic event.
?: Use Case: Useful in React to hold onto event data for asynchronous functions or debugging.

!Advanced Properties to Explore (For In-Depth Knowledge)::

*: bubbles: Boolean indicating whether the event propagates (bubbles) up through the DOM.
?: Use Case: You can check if an event is set to bubble, useful for conditional event handling in delegation.
*: composed: Indicates whether the event crosses shadow DOM boundaries.
?: Use Case: Manage event propagation in Web Components and shadow DOM.
*: view: Refers to the window object where the event occurred (i.e., window).
?: Use Case: Primarily used in UI events to track which window is responsible for the event.
*: detail (UI Events): Provides additional information specific to certain events (e.g., number of clicks for a click event).
?: Use Case: Detect double-clicks, zoom gestures, or other complex interactions.

                   !Key Takeaways:
*:  Master Event Control: preventDefault(), stopPropagation(), stopImmediatePropagation() are essential to mastering event flow and preventing unwanted actions.
*:  Handle Modifiers: Understanding modifier keys (altKey, ctrlKey, etc.) can make your app more responsive to power users who rely on keyboard shortcuts.
*:  Multi-Device Handling: Properties like pointerId and pointerType make you capable of handling events across different input types (touch, pen, mouse).
*:  Know Your Event Path: target, currentTarget, composedPath() allow precise control over event delegation and bubbling in complex UIs.
