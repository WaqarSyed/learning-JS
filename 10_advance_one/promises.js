// The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
/* A promise is in one of these states:
 * pending: neither fulfilled nor rejected.
 * completed: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
 * rejected: meaning that the operation failed. */
