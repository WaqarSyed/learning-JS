# Tagging and Boxing of Values

## Tagging :

- JavaScript engines use tags to represent the type of a variable in memory. Small integers (SMI) are typically tagged differently from other data types for efficient processing.

## Boxing

- When dealing with mixed data types, the engine may box (wrap) a value in a different structure, which takes extra memory and CPU cycles. For example, when you mix Number values and String values in an array, it can lead to boxing.

### Optimization Tip:

- Try to keep data types consistent within arrays and objects to avoid unnecessary boxing.
