# Typed Arrays

- Typed Arrays are array-like objects that provide a way to work with raw binary data (e.g. Uint8Array, Float32Array). These Arrays are faster and use less memory than standard JavaScript arrays because they're stored in contiguous memory and are not flexible in types.

## Use Case

- Typed arrays are ideal for performance-critical applications like image processing, scientific computations, and WebGL.
